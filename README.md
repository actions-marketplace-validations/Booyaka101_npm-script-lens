# npm-script-lens

**Know what an install script actually does before you approve it.**

_The install-script-approval tool for **npm · pnpm · yarn · bun**, from your **CLI**, **CI**, **editor**, and **AI agent**._

Since [npm v12 (July 8, 2026)](https://github.blog/changelog/2026-07-08-npm-install-time-security-and-gat-bypass2fa-deprecation/), dependency lifecycle scripts (`preinstall`, `install`, `postinstall`) and implicit `node-gyp` builds **no longer run unless explicitly allowed** via the `allowScripts` field in `package.json`. [git and remote-URL dependencies **no longer resolve at all**](#git-and-remote-dependencies-the-other-two-npm-v12-flips) unless opted in via `allow-git`/`allow-remote`. And npm isn't alone: **pnpm** (`allowBuilds`), **yarn** Berry (`dependenciesMeta.built`), and **bun** (`trustedDependencies`) all made install scripts opt-in too. That leaves every team, on every package manager, staring at a list of package names asking: *which of these are safe to approve?*

`npm-script-lens` answers that with evidence, not vibes: the review-report mode the community asked for in [npm/rfcs#897](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/issues/897). For every package in your lockfile (`package-lock.json`, `npm-shrinkwrap.json`, `yarn.lock` (classic and berry), `pnpm-lock.yaml`, or `bun.lock`) it:

1. fetches the version metadata from the public npm registry,
2. stream-downloads the tarball and indexes its source files (`tar-stream`, nothing written to disk), skipped entirely for the majority of packages with no install-time scripts, which is why real audits take seconds,
3. statically analyzes each `preinstall`/`install`/`postinstall` script with `acorn`, including the JS the script actually runs: `node <file>` targets, `node -e` eval bodies, relative `require()`/`import` chains, `path.join(__dirname, …)` indirections, and `npm run <target>` recursion into the package's own scripts (3 levels deep, cycle-safe). Packages that ship a root `binding.gyp` with no install script get their **implicit `node-gyp rebuild`** surfaced too, since npm v12 blocks those builds as well. (`prepare` is deliberately excluded: npm never runs it for registry-installed deps, and flagging leftover `"prepare": "husky install"` lines would be noise.)
4. **reads inside `binding.gyp`** (and the `.gypi`/`.gyp` files it includes) for native packages, see [the gyp lens](#the-gyp-lens-what-is-actually-inside-bindinggyp), because gyp *runs* the commands in that file at configure time,
5. scores the behavior and emits a Markdown report plus a **ready-to-paste, version-pinned `allowScripts` block**,
6. adds context to every risky package: **how it entered your tree** (`via prisma → @prisma/engines`), **whether OSV lists it as malicious** (⛔ hard flag, always denied), and **publisher trust signals** (publish age, weekly downloads, maintainer count, and the [resolved provenance identity](#provenance-an-identity-not-a-checkbox): which repository, workflow, ref and commit the attestation claims built it), so "🔴 HIGH, 74M dl/wk, 10 years old" reads differently from "🔴 HIGH, published 4 days ago, 12 dl/wk".

| Risk | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 🔴 HIGH | spawns processes (`child_process`, `execa`, `node-gyp`, unresolved binaries) **or runs constructed code** (`eval`, `new Function`, `vm`, string-built `require()`, base64/char-code payload decoding) |
| 🟠 MEDIUM | network access (`http(s).get/request`, `fetch`, `axios`/`got`/`node-fetch`/…) without exec |
| 🟡 LOW | filesystem writes or `process.env` reads only |
| 🟢 SAFE | none of the above |

Results are cached on disk keyed `name@version` + tool version (published tarballs are immutable), so repeat audits are near-instant and fully offline. `--no-cache` opts out; `NPM_SCRIPT_LENS_CACHE_DIR` relocates the cache.

## CLI

```bash
npx npm-script-lens audit --path ./my-project --fail-on-high
# --path PATH   project dir or lockfile: package-lock.json, npm-shrinkwrap.json,
#               yarn.lock, pnpm-lock.yaml, bun.lock (default: .). A directory
#               with no lockfile searches upward like npm does; a directory of
#               checkouts audits every project underneath
# --json        machine-readable output ({results, allowScripts}, or {projects}
#               when more than one project was found)
# --out FILE    write report to a file
# --sarif FILE  also write SARIF 2.1.0 for GitHub code scanning
# --html FILE   also write a self-contained, shareable HTML report
# --diff BASE   audit only packages added/upgraded vs a base lockfile
# --since REF   like --diff, but extract the base lockfile from a git ref
# --offline     analyze node_modules on disk instead of the registry
# --no-trust    skip OSV/downloads/provenance enrichment
# --no-cache    disable the on-disk result cache
# --fail-on-high  exit 1 if any package scores HIGH or is known malicious
# --cooldown [h]  exit 1 if any locked version is younger than N hours (default 72)
# --cooldown-allow PKG...  exempt from --cooldown, by name or name@version
# --fail-on-downgrade  exit 1 if any package resolves below the highest trust
#               tier it previously reached (npm/cli#9242); policy
#               trustPolicy: "no-downgrade" reports without failing
# --fail-on-runtime-bootstrap  exit 1 if any package installs another JS runtime
#               (bun, deno) at install time; policy runtimeBootstrapPolicy:
#               "fail" arms the same gate
```

Reviewing a PR? Audit only what changed, and see what **upgrades gained**:

```bash
npx npm-script-lens audit --since origin/main --fail-on-high   # base lockfile pulled from the ref for you
# …or point --diff at a base lockfile you extracted yourself:
git show origin/main:package-lock.json > /tmp/base-lock.json
npx npm-script-lens audit --diff /tmp/base-lock.json --fail-on-high
```

In diff mode, a package that was already in the tree but changed version is compared against the base version's analysis: `**⚠️ gained vs 1.2.0:** net: fetch()` is the fingerprint of a hijacked release (event-stream, the 2025 Shai-Hulud wave); `no new capabilities vs 1.2.0` is a boring upgrade.

## The gyp lens: what is actually inside `binding.gyp`?

`npm-script-lens` is the only install-script allowlist/approval tool that reads
**inside** `binding.gyp` and `.gypi`, and the only one that **diffs them
between versions**.

Every such tool (including this one, before v1.3.0) treated `binding.gyp` as a
flag: present ⇒ "implicit `node-gyp rebuild`". But gyp *evaluates* that file
before a line of C is compiled, and executes the commands in it,
[`subprocess.run(contents, stdout=PIPE, shell=use_shell, …)`](https://github.com/nodejs/gyp-next/blob/main/pylib/gyp/input.py)
in gyp-next. So the build file is a place to put install-time code where
approval tooling was not looking. That is what the June 2026 campaign used:
[ReversingLabs, 2026-06-04](https://www.reversinglabs.com/blog/npm-bindinggyp-cicd-secrets)
(286 malicious versions across 56 packages), whose payload was a single line:

```json
{"targets":[{"target_name":"Setup","type":"none","sources":["<!(node index.js > /dev/null 2>&1 && echo stub.c)"]}]}
```

[Aikido's 2026-06-09 teardown](https://www.aikido.dev/blog/exploring-binding-gyp-npm-build-system)
enumerates the channels; `npm-script-lens` covers all of them:

| Channel | What it does |
|---|---|
| `<!(` `<!@(` | command expansion: gyp runs it in a shell and substitutes the output |
| `>!(` `>!@(` `^!(` `^!@(` | the same thing in gyp's *late* and *latelate* phases, one character apart from `<!(`, and invisible to a naive scan |
| `<!pymod_do_main(` (+ `>`/`^`) | imports a Python module and calls its `DoMain()` |
| `<\|(` `>\|(` `^\|(` | listfile expansion |
| `actions[].action` · `rules[].action` · `postbuilds[].action` | explicit build steps that run commands |
| `make_global_settings` | replaces `CC`/`CXX`/`LINK`, a compiler hijack |
| `conditions` | flagged when the condition string reaches for the Python-eval sandbox escape (`__class__`, `__subclasses__`, `__import__`, `__builtins__`) |

Plain `<(var)` / `<@(var)` interpolation is **never** flagged, real files mix
both, and `bufferutil`'s `<!(cc -v …)` sitting next to its `<(clang_version)`
is a committed regression test.

`review` prints what will run above the file itself. Real output for
`better-sqlite3@11.10.0`, note the findings come from `deps/sqlite3.gyp`, a
file the parent `binding.gyp` only *references*:

```
── better-sqlite3@11.10.0  [🔴 HIGH]
   deps/sqlite3.gyp:28  actions[].action build action → node copy.js <(SHARED_INTERMEDIATE_DIR)/sqlite3
   deps/sqlite3.gyp:41  actions[].action build action → node copy.js <(SHARED_INTERMEDIATE_DIR)/sqlite3 <(sqlite3)
   ┌─ binding.gyp (39 lines)
   │   1  # ===
   │   2  # This is the main GYP file, which builds better-sqlite3 with SQLite itself.
   …
```

In `audit`, these become `gyp:` signals that score **HIGH** (a shell command at
install time is a shell command), appear in `--sarif` under the rule
`gyp-exec-channel`, and can be banned outright via a policy's
`denyCapabilities: ["gyp"]`.

> **Upgrading from ≤ 1.2.0?** A `manifest --check` baseline containing native
> packages may now show a new `gyp` capability, the tool sees something it
> previously could not. Re-baseline once with `manifest --write` and commit it.

## RUNTIME_BOOTSTRAP: installing a different runtime to step outside the model

Approval tooling models a **Node** payload. It reads the JavaScript that
`preinstall` runs, follows its `require()` chain, and scores what it does. That
model has an edge, and on 2026-08-04 the ChainDrop worm walked out of it across
[more than 400 packages](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2026/08/04/chaindrop-supply-chain-compromise-anatomy-self-propagating-worm/).

Its preinstall was `node setup.mjs`, a command this tool already followed. The
escape was inside that JavaScript. The dropper fetched a real, signed Bun
release from the project's own GitHub releases, unpacked it, and ran a bundled
second stage under that fresh interpreter. Microsoft's own detections name the
technique: "Suspicious installation of Bun runtime." Two things about that stage
defeated a Node-shaped scan: it ran under a different interpreter, and it was
never `require()`d, it was passed as a file path to a spawn call, so the
require-walk never reached it.

So the runtime table is no longer one entry long. A file handed to `node`,
`nodejs`, `bun`, `deno run`, `tsx`, `ts-node`, or the `npx` / `bunx` / `bun x`
runner forms is opened from the tarball and analyzed with the same acorn pass,
and its capabilities merge into the package score. Inside that pass, a download
whose URL points at a JavaScript-runtime distribution is flagged, and a
`child_process` / `spawn` / `exec` call whose string argument resolves to a file
in the tarball is queued into the same walk, so the second stage is analyzed
like any other entry point.

A package that does this gets a `RUNTIME_BOOTSTRAP` finding, scored **HIGH**,
that names the technique instead of folding it into a generic "spawns
processes":

```
🔴 HIGH  RUNTIME_BOOTSTRAP  downloads bun from oven-sh/bun releases, then runs it on the bundled payload
```

The capabilities of that bundled payload (its network calls, its environment
reads) are merged into the same finding and attributed to the bootstrapped
runtime, so a stage that reads a token and phones home reads as exactly that,
not as a mystery second file. The detector recognises the two runtimes' own
install scripts, their release archive names, the `oven-sh/bun` release URLs, a
global install of bun or deno through a package manager, and a shell pipe that
installs one of them. Both shapes ChainDrop used land here: the `node setup.mjs`
dropper, and the shell one-liner that installs bun and then runs a bundled
payload with it.

Installing a runtime is the signal; **using one is not**. A package that runs
`bun run build` on a script it already ships is not flagged, that is an ordinary
bun-native build. An alternate-runtime entry point that does not resolve to a
file in the tarball degrades to the generic HIGH rather than crashing.

In `audit --diff` / `--since`, a version that newly acquires a runtime bootstrap
gets an explicit line, because ChainDrop republished each hijacked package as an
ordinary patch bump:

```
⚠️ gained vs 1.0.0: runtime bootstrap (bun)
```

`--fail-on-runtime-bootstrap` exits 1 on the pattern, independent of
`--fail-on-high`, and a checked-in `runtimeBootstrapPolicy: "fail"` in
`script-lens.policy.json` arms the same gate for a whole team. The finding rides
`--json` (`results[].runtimeBootstrap`) and SARIF (rule `runtime-bootstrap`,
level error) alongside every other finding.

## diff: what did an upgrade change in the install scripts?

Before you bump a pin, see exactly which install-time behavior a new version adds or changes, the surface npm v12 will ask you to re-approve. `diff` compares the `preinstall`/`install`/`postinstall` scripts (and the implicit `node-gyp rebuild` that ships with a root `binding.gyp`) between two versions, straight from the registry:

```bash
npx npm-script-lens diff sharp@0.32.6 sharp@0.33.0
# --json   emit { unchanged, added, removed, modified, gyp } instead of colored text
```

```
sharp@0.32.6 → sharp@0.33.0
REMOVED: implicit node-gyp rebuild (binding.gyp)
MODIFIED: install
    - (node install/libvips && node install/dll-copy && prebuild-install) || …
    + node install/check
```

- **UNCHANGED** (green): key present in both, byte-identical
- **ADDED** (red): a new script, or a gained `binding.gyp` → `ADDED: implicit node-gyp rebuild (binding.gyp)`
- **REMOVED** (yellow): a script that went away
- **MODIFIED** (red): same key, changed content, with a line-level diff
- **PROVENANCE IDENTITY CHANGED** (red): the attested build identity moved, see below

`diff` also resolves each version's [provenance identity](#provenance-an-identity-not-a-checkbox) and compares it. A version built from `acme/widget .github/workflows/release.yml@refs/tags/v1.2.0` upgrading to one built from `.github/workflows/hotfix.yml@refs/heads/main` prints:

```
PROVENANCE IDENTITY CHANGED  workflow .github/workflows/release.yml → .github/workflows/hotfix.yml, ref refs/tags/v1.2.0 → refs/heads/main
```

and exits 1, the same gate as an added or modified install script: the workflow that produced the artifact is not the one that produced the version you already trust. Provenance appearing or disappearing across the upgrade gates too. A new commit alone never does (every release has one), and an identity that cannot be resolved on either side is never compared, so registry hiccups cannot fail your CI. When the identity is present and unchanged, a green `UNCHANGED: provenance identity …` line says so.

`binding.gyp` is compared **by content, not by existence** (fixed in 1.3.0). A
version that keeps its build file but *rewrites* it changes what runs at
install time, and used to slip through as `UNCHANGED` / exit 0, the shape the
June 2026 wave-2 releases had. Now:

```
$ npx npm-script-lens diff bufferutil@4.0.8 bufferutil@4.0.9
bufferutil@4.0.8 → bufferutil@4.0.9
UNCHANGED: install
MODIFIED: binding.gyp (implicit node-gyp rebuild, contents changed)
      {
    +   'variables': {
    +     'openssl_fips': ''
    +   },
        'targets': [
…
$ echo $?
1
```

`--json` carries `{ gyp: { changed, gainedChannels } }`; `gainedChannels` lists
gyp execution channels present in the new version and absent from the old (here
it is empty, a benign build-file edit, no new way to run a command). It also
carries `{ provenance: { changed, changes, old, new } }` with the resolved
identity of both sides.

Exit `0` when everything is unchanged; exit `1` the moment any script is **added or modified** or the **provenance identity changed**, so a Renovate/Dependabot CI step can fail the moment an upgrade grows its install-time surface. (A pure removal stays exit `0`.)

## git and remote dependencies: the other two npm v12 flips

npm v12 doesn't just gate install *scripts*, it also stops resolving **git
dependencies** (`github:user/repo`, `git+ssh://…`) and **remote tarball URLs**
(`https://…/pkg.tgz`) unless you opt in via `allow-git` / `allow-remote` in
`.npmrc`. Both are the strict enum `all` | `none` | `root` (default `none`);
`root` allows only deps declared in your **root** package.json, so a single
*transitive* git dep forces `all`. There's no migration tooling upstream, the
[official discussion](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/198547)'s
best offer is `grep -r 'git+' package.json`. `sources` does the whole job:

```bash
npx npm-script-lens sources                # report + the minimal correct .npmrc
npx npm-script-lens sources --check        # CI: exit 1 on insufficient, over-permissive, or invalid config
npx npm-script-lens sources --write        # merge the minimal values into .npmrc (comment-preserving)
npx npm-script-lens sources --json         # { git, remote, npmrc }
```

Real output for a project with a root-declared git dep and a transitive one:

```
git dependencies (2)
  ROOT        left-pad @ github:left-pad/left-pad
  TRANSITIVE  some-pkg @ git+ssh://git@github.com/a/b.git   via my-lib -> some-pkg
remote dependencies (0)

minimal correct .npmrc:
  allow-git=all

allow-git=all is required because 1 git dependency is transitive; allow-git=root would otherwise suffice.
Re-point or drop `some-pkg` (via my-lib) to tighten this to allow-git=root.
```

It reads all four lockfile dialects (package-lock v1/v2/v3, yarn classic +
berry, pnpm, bun.lock) with **zero network calls**, and `--check` fails in
three *distinct* ways so CI tells you what to do:

- **insufficient**: npm v12 will refuse the install (missing `.npmrc`, or
  `root` committed while a transitive git dep exists);
- **over-permissive**: `all` committed where `root` (or nothing) suffices:
  the least-privilege ratchet;
- **invalid**: `allow-git=true` or a bare `--allow-git`, which several
  published migration guides recommend, is **not in the enum**: npm treats it
  as unset and your install still breaks. The check names the valid three.

`allow --ci-check` folds the insufficient/invalid cases into its fast CI gate
too, and `doctor` reports whether your npm has the keys at all (they appeared
in 11.10.0 / 11.15.0) and warns that `allow-git=root` is unreliable on npm 11
([npm/cli#9189](https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/9189), closed via PR #9206,
root-level git deps were wrongly rejected): prefer `all` there. The `.npmrc`
emitter is npm-only; for yarn/pnpm/bun lockfiles the dependency report still
works, the write is skipped with a note.

## cooldown: don't be the first to install a version

Every other check here asks *what does this package do?*. Cooldown asks only
*how old is this version?*

On 2026-08-04 attackers compromised the `keyv` maintainer's GitHub account
(~127M weekly downloads) and pushed the Mini Shai-Hulud worm into `keyv`,
`cacheable`, `flat-cache` and `file-entry-cache`. It spread to nine unrelated
organisations in about half an hour and 400+ packages that day, and, like
every worm before it, was identified and unpublished within hours. The install
that hurts you is the one that lands inside that window.

So don't go first.

```bash
# fail the build if any locked version is younger than 72h (the default)
npm-script-lens audit --cooldown

# stricter, or looser
npm-script-lens audit --cooldown 24

# ship a genuine same-day fix anyway
npm-script-lens audit --cooldown --cooldown-allow hotfix-pkg@2.0.1
```

```
✗ cooldown 72h: 1 package version(s) published too recently:
  keyv@5.5.5  6.0h old  (clears 2026-08-07 14:00Z)

These may be perfectly fine. Cooldown does not inspect them. It declines to be
among the first to install a version, because npm worms are typically caught
within hours. Wait, pin to an older version, or exempt with --cooldown-allow.
```

Notes:

- It is **opt-in**. Without the flag, nothing changes.
- Age comes from the absolute publish timestamp at evaluation time, never from
  a cached day-resolution age, a stale cache errs toward *older*, which would
  fail open on precisely the young version this is meant to catch.
- Packages with no publish date (`--offline`, private registries) are listed as
  unchecked rather than blocked.
- Because a poisoned version doesn't need a lifecycle hook to hurt you,
  `--cooldown` fetches publish dates for **every** locked package, not just the
  ones with install scripts. That is more registry traffic than a plain audit.

## cooldown config: your package manager has one too, in a different unit

`--cooldown` above is a CI gate. It reads the lockfile and fails the build.
It says nothing about the cooldown a contributor's own `pnpm install` applies,
and all four managers now have one:

| manager | file | key | unit | its own default |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| npm | `.npmrc` | `min-release-age` | **days** | `null`, no gate |
| pnpm | `pnpm-workspace.yaml` | `minimumReleaseAge` | **minutes** | `1440` since pnpm 11, `0` before |
| yarn | `.yarnrc.yml` | `npmMinimalAgeGate` | **minutes**, or a duration string | `1d` since Yarn 4.15.0 |
| bun | `bunfig.toml` `[install]` | `minimumReleaseAge` | **seconds** | `null`, no gate |

So `3` is three days, three minutes or three seconds depending on the file, and
getting it wrong does not fail. The install succeeds and the gate is not there.
[yarnpkg/berry#6991](https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/issues/6991) is that
happening to someone: they set `npmMinimalAgeGate: "7d"` from the docs and a
five-day-old release installed anyway, because their Yarn predated duration
strings and read it through `parseInt`, giving seven minutes.

```bash
npm-script-lens cooldown            # report, always exits 0
npm-script-lens cooldown --check    # exit 1 on MISSING, UNIT-SUSPECT or DRIFT
npm-script-lens cooldown --write --cooldown 72
```

A pnpm project with `minimumReleaseAge: 3` and a CI job running
`npm-script-lens audit --cooldown 72`:

```
$ npm-script-lens cooldown --check
cooldown config — pnpm (pnpm-workspace.yaml)
  UNIT-SUSPECT  minimumReleaseAge: 3  → 3 minutes (pnpm counts MINUTES), not 3 days
                pnpm's own default is 1440 (1 day); 3 gates essentially nothing
  DRIFT         configured 0.05h < enforced 72h (--cooldown in .github/workflows/ci.yml)
                A version this project's own CI would block still installs on a contributor's machine.
  fix:  npm-script-lens cooldown --write --cooldown 72
        writes  minimumReleaseAge: 4320
```

`--write` then puts `4320` in, leaving every other key, comment, blank line and
the file's EOL style exactly as they were.

The four statuses:

- **OK**: configured, in the right unit, at or above what CI enforces. The
  converted hours is printed either way, so you can check the arithmetic.
- **MISSING**: nothing configured while `--cooldown` is enforced in CI. Only
  CI is protected; every local install goes straight through. If a pnpm project
  has `minimumReleaseAge` sitting in `.npmrc`, the finding says so and points at
  that line: pnpm reads only auth and registry settings from `.npmrc`, so the
  value is dead where it is.
- **UNIT-SUSPECT**: the value gates under an hour or over a month, *and* the
  same number reads as a sensible cooldown in one of the other managers' units.
  Both halves are required, so a deliberately odd threshold with no plausible
  alternative reading is reported OK, not flagged.
- **DRIFT**: configured below the enforced threshold, or exempt lists that
  disagree with `--cooldown-allow`. The comparison uses what the manager
  *actually* gates, which is not always what the file says: an old Yarn
  truncating `7d` to seven minutes drifts on seven minutes.

Two more lines appear in the report but never fail `--check`, because neither
is something the project got wrong:

- **PARTIAL**: a config file this tool cannot round-trip. Nothing is rewritten.
- **UNSUPPORTED**: a `--cooldown-allow` entry this manager cannot express, so
  it was left out rather than written into a key that would ignore it.

Where the enforced number comes from: `--cooldown <hours>` if you pass it,
otherwise the strictest `--cooldown` this repo's own CI configs run
(`.github/workflows/*.yml`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `.circleci/config.yml`, searched
upward so a monorepo package finds the root's). If nothing enforces a cooldown
anywhere, there is no MISSING and no DRIFT to report.

Exemptions are translated into the manager's own exclude key, and only in the
forms that manager accepts:

| manager | exclude key | accepts |
|---|---|---|
| npm | `min-release-age-exclude` | names or minimatch globs |
| pnpm | `minimumReleaseAgeExclude` | names, `@myorg/*` patterns, versions joined with `\|\|` |
| yarn | `npmPreapprovedPackages` | package descriptors or name globs |
| bun | `minimumReleaseAgeExcludes` | package names only |

`npm-script-lens cooldown --write --cooldown-allow urgent-fix pkg@1.2.3`
against a bun project writes `urgent-fix` and skips `pkg@1.2.3` with a note:
bun matches on names, so writing the descriptor would be a gate you believe in
and bun ignores. Nothing is ever exempted that you did not pass.

Yarn specifics, because Yarn's gate has moved four times:

- Duration strings (`3d`, `1w`) arrived in **4.11.0**
  ([#6942](https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/pull/6942)). Below that the setting
  is `SettingsType.NUMBER` and a string is silently truncated by `parseInt`.
  This is reported **against the version your project pins** (`packageManager`,
  then `yarnPath`), never as a blanket warning: on current Yarn `7d` is exact.
- `--write` emits Yarn's own `3d` idiom, and bare minutes instead on a project
  pinned below 4.11.0.
- A per-scope gate under `npmScopes`
  ([#7156](https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/pull/7156), Yarn 4.17.0) is read
  and reported. It is never rewritten: exempting an internal registry is what
  that feature is for.

Other surfaces:

```bash
npm-script-lens audit --cooldown 72 --cooldown-config   # both halves in one run
npm-script-lens cooldown --json
npm-script-lens cooldown --check --sarif cooldown.sarif # rule cooldown-config
npm-script-lens doctor                                  # one line, with the converted hours
```

In the Action, opt in the same way as `sources-check`:

```yaml
- uses: Booyaka101/npm-script-lens@v1
  with:
    cooldown-check: 'true'
```

Limits worth knowing: a `bunfig.toml` this tool cannot round-trip (a multi-line
array, for instance) is reported `PARTIAL` and `--write` refuses it rather than
reformatting your file. The enforced threshold is found by reading `--cooldown`
out of CI *files*; a threshold assembled from a shell variable at runtime is not
visible to it, so pass `--cooldown <hours>` in that case. And this reads
committed config only, never your global `~/.npmrc`: the point is what everyone
who clones the repo gets.

## Provenance: an identity, not a checkbox

The malicious `keyv@6.0.0` of 2026-08-04 carried a **valid** npm attestation
naming GitHub Actions as its trusted publisher.
[Snyk's teardown](https://snyk.io/blog/inside-keyv-npm-compromise-preinstall-malware-trusted-provenance-ide-hooks/)
draws the boundary in one sentence: *"Provenance can faithfully attest a build
whose source or workflow context has already been compromised."* A green
`provenance ✓` on its own is therefore close to worthless as a trust signal,
and this tool no longer stops there. When a version carries an attestation,
the audit resolves what it actually **claims**, from the registry's
attestation endpoint (the SLSA v1 predicate): the source repository, workflow
path, ref, commit and builder. The trust line in every report reads:

```
2.1y old · 127M dl/wk · 1 maintainer · provenance ✓ github.com/jaredwray/keyv .github/workflows/release.yml@refs/heads/main 4a91c0e
```

and `provenance ✓ (identity unavailable)` when the registry's answer is not a
shape this build can resolve. The identity rides the same 24h trust cache, and
`--offline` / `--no-trust` make zero attestation requests.

**What we read, and what we do not verify.** This tool reads the claims the
registry serves over TLS and does **not** verify Sigstore signatures or
transparency-log inclusion. That is the same trust boundary as the tarball
itself: if you trust the registry to hand you the package bytes, these are the
claims it hands you alongside them. Nothing here should be described as
cryptographic verification, because it is not.

**Honesty about what this catches.** ChainDrop's attacker published through
each project's own repository and own release workflow, so the attested
identity matched perfectly and **this feature would not have caught it**.
Neither would it have caught the TanStack compromise three months earlier
(2026-05-11, 84 malicious versions across 42 `@tanstack/*` packages, the first
worm to ship validly-attested malicious packages). There, a
`pull_request_target` workflow that publishes nothing poisoned a shared pnpm
cache; `release.yml` restored it on main; the payload read the OIDC token out
of the runner's memory and posted straight to the registry. The
[postmortem](https://tanstack.com/blog/npm-supply-chain-compromise-postmortem)
is explicit about what an identity check would have seen: *"The token's
attested identity still matched `TanStack/router release.yml@refs/heads/main`."*
Worth noting that this tool's own [DANGEROUS gate](#release-gates-who-can-publish-today)
would have missed it too, since it flags a publish path reachable from
`pull_request_target` and that publish path was not reachable from one. The
link was a shared cache scope, not the trigger graph.

The defence in this tool for both events is [`--cooldown`](#cooldown-dont-be-the-first-to-install-a-version),
and the window is narrow enough for it to work: TanStack's malicious versions
were publicly identified within 20 to 26 minutes.
What identity resolution does catch: an attested repository that disagrees
with the package's declared repository, and a build identity that **moves**
between the version you trust and the version you are installing, the
[`diff` gate above](#diff-what-did-an-upgrade-change-in-the-install-scripts)
and the `expectProvenance` [policy pin](#governance-policy). Honesty about prior art, because there is real prior art here. npmjs.com's
package page already shows Build Environment, Build Summary, Source Commit and
Build File for a provenance-carrying version. `npm audit signatures` checks
registry signatures and attestations. And
[cosign](https://blog.sigstore.dev/cosign-verify-bundles/) already pins an
expected identity, cryptographically, which this tool does not do:

```bash
cosign verify-blob-attestation --bundle npm-provenance.sigstore.json --new-bundle-format \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer="https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com" \
  --certificate-identity-regexp="^https://github.com/npm/node-semver/.github/workflows/release-integration.yml.?" \
  semver-7.6.3.tgz
```

If you need cryptographic assurance for one package, use that, not this. What
those tools do not do is work at **tree scale**: cosign verifies one artifact
against one bundle you already fetched, and the npmjs.com page covers one
package you are already looking at. This tool resolves the identity for
**every dependency in one CI run**, **diffs it across an upgrade**, and
expresses the expectation as **checked-in policy** rather than a regex in a
shell command. That is the gap it fills, and it is narrower than "we surface
provenance identity."

Two more surfaces carry it: `audit --diff`/`--since` reports
`provenance identity changed vs <base>` per upgraded package next to the
capabilities-gained note (informational there, it never changes the audit exit
code), and SARIF gains `provenance-identity-changed` (warning) plus
`provenance-repo-drift` (note). The repo-drift note fires when the attestation
names a different owner/repo than the packument declares, with both values
spelled out. It is deliberately informational and never gates anything: npm
requires your `package.json` repository to match where you publish from with
provenance and re-checks the linked source when provenance is viewed, so a
live mismatch is almost always a repo rename or transfer since publish, not an
attack. Monorepo subpaths never count as drift. `doctor` reports whether the
attestation endpoint answered.

## trust: the downgrade a stolen token cannot avoid

The March 2026 axios compromise had a tell that no behavioral scan needed: the
attacker had the maintainer's npm token but not the maintainer's CI, so where
every recent legitimate release carried a provenance attestation, the malicious
`1.14.1` and `0.30.4` carried none. That drop, a version resolving **below the
highest trust tier its package previously reached**, is what
[npm/cli#9242](https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/9242) (59 👍, open since
April 2026) and [yarnpkg/berry#7101](https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/issues/7101)
ask their package managers to refuse. **pnpm shipped it natively as
`trust-policy=no-downgrade` in 10.21. npm and Yarn have not**, and this command
is that gate for their lockfiles (and pnpm's and bun's too):

```bash
npx npm-script-lens trust --fail-on-downgrade
```

```
npm-script-lens trust: provenance downgrade check (npm/cli#9242, trusted publisher > provenance > none)
checked 3 registry package(s)

TRUST DOWNGRADE (1)
  axios@1.13.3  provenance -> none
    highest prior trust: provenance (axios@1.13.2, published 2025-11-04)
    resolved version has no attestations
    pnpm >= 10.21 would refuse this install under trust-policy=no-downgrade
```

That output is real, not staged: axios `1.13.3` (published 2026-01-25, still on
the registry today) genuinely carries no attestations while `1.13.2` before it
carried provenance. Exit code is 1 only under `--fail-on-downgrade`, and only
when a downgrade is present.

The ladder matches #9242: **trusted publisher > provenance > none**. A
trusted-publisher (OIDC) publish is recognized by the registry's
`_npmUser.trustedPublisher` stamp on the version; provenance is
`dist.attestations` on the version (the SLSA predicate rides along); absent
attestations is none. One packument request per package answers all three
tiers for every version at once, cached 24h alongside the other trust data.

What never fires a finding: packages that have never published with
attestations (there is no ratchet to fall from), a package's first published
version, versions published *after* the one you resolve (a later provenance
adoption says nothing about your pin), git/remote-sourced dependencies (their
history is not the registry's), and an unreachable registry, which warns once
and exits 0 rather than failing your build on network weather. A previously
unpublished version leaves a gap that is compared **around**, never counted as
a downgrade. Deprecated versions still count toward the max.

`audit` runs the same check when you opt in, either with
`audit --fail-on-downgrade` or with the policy key, and emits the finding in
the report, `--json` (`results[].trustDowngrade`) and SARIF (rule
`trust-downgrade`, level error, anchored to the package's lockfile line):

```jsonc
// script-lens.policy.json, npm/cli#9242's keys so your config carries over
// if npm ever ships trust-policy natively
{
  "trustPolicy": "no-downgrade",          // #9242: trust-policy (default "off")
  "trustPolicyExclude": ["pkg@1.2.3"],    // #9242: trust-policy-exclude[]
  "trustPolicyIgnoreAfter": 525600        // #9242: trust-policy-ignore-after (minutes)
}
```

`trustPolicy: "no-downgrade"` makes every `audit` surface the finding without
changing any exit code; the exit only flips under `--fail-on-downgrade`, so no
existing CI changes colour without opting in. `trustPolicyExclude` allows a
named version despite its drop (a maintainer who genuinely moved off CI);
`trustPolicyIgnoreAfter` retires prior evidence older than the window. The
`trust` command also takes them directly as `--exclude pkg@version` and
`--ignore-after minutes`.

**Honest limitations.** A package whose 0.x maintenance line is published by
hand while the 1.x line uses CI will flag the 0.x versions, exactly as pnpm's
`trust-policy=no-downgrade` refuses them (real example: axios `0.30.x`);
that is what `trustPolicyExclude` is for. And like the
[provenance identity check](#provenance-an-identity-not-a-checkbox), this
reads registry claims over TLS, it does not verify Sigstore signatures. It
also cannot catch an attacker who compromises the CI itself and publishes
*with* provenance, the ChainDrop shape; `--cooldown` and the identity diff are
the tools for that half.

## publish: will your release workflow survive January 2027?

The other side of the same coin: npm-script-lens guards the *install* side of
your workflows; `publish` guards the *publish* side. The [GitHub changelog of
2026-07-31](https://github.blog/changelog/2026-07-31-restricting-npm-bypass-2fa-granular-access-tokens/)
is explicit: *"2FA-bypass tokens will also lose direct publish. Their
publishing surface will reduce to reading private packages and staging a
publish, which a maintainer approves with 2FA. We are targeting January 2027
for this update."* Phase 1 already shipped on 2026-07-31, so publishing is the
last thing those tokens can still do. If your release workflow does
`npm publish` with `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}`, it has an
expiry date.

```bash
npx npm-script-lens publish            # classify every CI publish path + the migration patch
npx npm-script-lens publish --check    # CI: exit 1 when a path uses a long-lived token or is BROKEN
npx npm-script-lens publish --json     # { cliff, floors, counts, paths, repo, engines }
npx npm-script-lens publish --sarif f  # rules publish-token-cliff + publish-oidc-broken, workflow-line anchored
```

It reads `.github/workflows/*.yml`, `.github/actions/**/action.yml`,
`.gitlab-ci.yml` and `.circleci/config.yml` (no network, no YAML dependency),
finds `npm publish`, `npm stage publish`, `pnpm publish`, `yarn npm publish`,
`np`, `semantic-release`, `changesets/action` and `JS-DevTools/npm-publish`,
and classifies each path as exactly one of:

- **TRUSTED**: an id-token grant (`permissions: id-token: write` or
  `write-all`; GitLab `id_tokens` with audience `npm:registry.npmjs.org`;
  CircleCI `NPM_ID_TOKEN`) and no token: already on [trusted publishing
  (OIDC)](https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers), survives the cliff;
- **STAGED**: `npm stage publish`, where a maintainer approves with 2FA
  (`npm stage approve <stage-id>`), survives the cliff;
- **TOKEN**: `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN`/`NPM_TOKEN` in the env, or an `.npmrc` write
  containing `_authToken`. **Stops working around January 2027**, and fails
  `--check`;
- **BROKEN**: trusted publishing is granted, but the job's
  `actions/setup-node` is v6 or older *and* passes
  `registry-url: https://registry.npmjs.org`. Every setup-node release up to
  v6 answers that input by writing
  `//registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=${NODE_AUTH_TOKEN}` into an `.npmrc` and
  exporting a dummy `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN`, so npm sees auth as configured and
  never starts the OIDC exchange, so the publish fails with ENEEDAUTH/E404
  ([npm/documentation#1960](https://github.com/npm/documentation/issues/1960);
  fixed in
  [setup-node v7.0.0](https://github.com/actions/setup-node/releases/tag/v7.0.0)).
  The official trusted-publishers docs still show the broken `@v6` recipe.
  Fails `--check`; the report gives all three fixes (bump to `@v7`, drop
  `registry-url:`, or `sed -i '/_authToken/d' "$NPM_CONFIG_USERCONFIG"`) and a
  job that already strips the line stays TRUSTED. An unresolvable setup-node
  ref (SHA pin, branch, expression) gets a ⚠️ note, never a downgrade;
- **UNKNOWN**: a publish exists but the auth is ambiguous (third-party
  reusable workflows, both grant and token, neither visible): reported, never
  a failure.

A publish step hidden behind `uses: ./.github/actions/release` is followed
into the composite action itself (and into local reusable workflows, nested up
to 3 levels): the path anchors to the real `action.yml` line, an indented
`via .github/workflows/release.yml:11 (job release, step "Release")` line
shows the call chain, and the auth threads the way GitHub threads it:
composite actions cannot declare `permissions`, so the id-token grant is
always the calling job's, and a composite
`env: NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ inputs.npm-token }}` is resolved through the
calling step's `with:` map back to `secrets.NPM_TOKEN`. A publishing composite
under `.github/actions/` that no workflow in the repo references is still
reported (UNKNOWN, since it may be called from another repo). Third-party actions
(`actions/checkout@v4`) are never flagged.

Then it does the three checks no migration blog performs:

1. **Version floors**, verbatim from docs.npmjs.com: trusted publishing
   *"requires npm CLI version 11.5.1 or later and Node version 22.14.0 or
   higher"*; staged publishing *"requires npm CLI version 11.15.0 or later and
   Node version 22.14.0 or higher."* A `setup-node` pin (or an
   `engines.node` minimum) below the floor is called out with exactly which
   fix it blocks. Migrating a workflow that's pinned to Node 20 fails at the
   first publish, so the pin bump is part of the fix.
2. **Runner eligibility.** Trusted publishing supports **only** GitHub-hosted
   runners, GitLab.com shared runners and CircleCI cloud: *"Self-hosted
   runners are not currently supported but are planned for future releases."*
   A `runs-on: self-hosted` publish job gets trusted publishing marked
   **UNAVAILABLE** and is routed to the one path that survives there:
   `npm stage publish` + `npm stage approve <stage-id>`.
3. **The npmjs.com side, pre-filled.** Trusted publishing also needs config on
   npmjs.com; `publish` emits the settings checklist filled in from your repo
   (org/user, repository, workflow filename *with its extension*, the
   environment name if the job declares one, and the allowed actions).

Real output for a workflow publishing with a token on Node 20:

```
publish paths (1)
  TOKEN     .github/workflows/release.yml:15  npm publish   [job release · ubuntu-latest]
            long-lived token: NODE_AUTH_TOKEN in the publish step env (line 17)

⛔ 1 TOKEN publish path. Direct token publishing stops working around January 2027.

fix for .github/workflows/release.yml:15, switch to trusted publishing (OIDC):
  add to the `release` job (or the workflow top level) in .github/workflows/release.yml:
    + permissions:
    +   id-token: write
  remove the token from the publish step (line 17):
    - env:
    -   NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
  ⚠️  node-version 20 (.github/workflows/release.yml:12) is below the Node 22.14.0 floor …

npmjs.com trusted-publisher settings (package Settings → Trusted publisher):
  GitHub organization or user: acme
  repository:                  widget
  workflow filename:           release.yml   (with its extension, exactly as on disk)
  environment:                 (the job declares none, leave blank)
  allowed actions:             npm publish   (also allow "npm stage publish" if you plan to stage releases)
```

`doctor` reports the same readiness mix (naming the setup-node ref on a
BROKEN path), and the GitHub Action's [`publish-check` input](#github-action)
fails the job with an `::error` and a `publish-token-cliff` /
`publish-oidc-broken` SARIF result when a TOKEN or BROKEN path remains.

### Release gates: who can publish *today*?

Auth answers "will this path publish after January 2027". It does not answer
the ChainDrop question. On 2026-08-04 that worm published 2,234 poisoned
versions across 444 npm package names by taking over a maintainer's GitHub
account and letting each project's own release workflow build, sign and
publish, with valid provenance, because the authorized build system produced
it. So `publish` now reports two more facts per resolved path: the **trigger**
(which workflow events reach the job, with file:line) and the **gate** (what
human action, if any, stands between a commit and `npm publish`):

- **DANGEROUS**: reachable from `pull_request_target` or `workflow_run`.
  crates.io removed both from Trusted Publishing (development update,
  2026-01-21): *"Both triggers have been involved in past CI security
  incidents, where attackers exploited workflow permissions to escalate
  access or obtain publishing credentials."* Fails `--check` on its own.
- **REVIEWABLE**: the job declares `environment:`, the one hook GitHub offers
  for required reviewers. PyPI's security model: *"Dedicated environments
  allow for additional protections like required reviewers, which can be used
  to require manual approval for a workflow using the environment."*
- **MANUAL**: only `workflow_dispatch` and/or `release` reach the job.
- **TAG**: `push` with a tags-only filter.
- **AUTO**: a branch push, bare push, schedule or pull_request, with no
  environment. Any commit that lands publishes.
- **UNKNOWN**: not determinable (e.g. `on: workflow_call` with no caller in
  this repo). Never affects the exit code.

The worked example, a release workflow publishing on every merge to main:

```
publish paths (1)
  TRUSTED   .github/workflows/release.yml:22  npm publish   [job release · ubuntu-latest]
            trusted publishing (OIDC): id-token: write granted (line 9), no
            token in the env
            trigger: push → branches: [main]   (.github/workflows/release.yml:3)
            gate:    AUTO: any commit that lands on main publishes to npm. The
                     job declares no environment:, so GitHub cannot require an
                     approval.
            fix:     add `environment: release` to job "release" (line 11) and
                     set required reviewers on it (PyPI: "Dedicated environments
                     allow for additional protections like required reviewers");
                     or move to `on: release: types: [published]`; or publish
                     with `npm stage publish` + `npm stage approve <stage-id>`.
```

(Reports reflow to your terminal width, so the wrapping above is what an
80-column terminal shows. Piped or redirected output is not reflowed.)

Add `environment: release` to that job and the gate reads REVIEWABLE.
Honesty note: whether required reviewers are actually configured on an
environment is a repository setting, not a file, so this tool cannot verify
it; REVIEWABLE says "verify required reviewers are configured on it" rather
than implying it checked. Triggers thread through local reusable workflows
and composite actions (a path reached via `.github/actions/release` inherits
the calling workflow's `on:`). GitLab jobs classify from `environment:`,
`when: manual` and tag-only `rules:`/`only:`; CircleCI from an approval-type
job upstream in the same workflow; anything else stays UNKNOWN, never a
guess.

`publish --check` exits 1 on DANGEROUS (plus TOKEN and BROKEN, as before).
`--require-gate <none|tag|manual|environment>` (default `none`) raises the
bar: `tag` fails AUTO paths, `manual` also fails TAG, `environment` demands
REVIEWABLE. SARIF gains `publish-dangerous-trigger` (error) and, under
`--require-gate`, `publish-ungated` (warning), anchored to the trigger line.

To be clear about what is new here: zizmor's `dangerous-triggers` audit
already flags `pull_request_target` and `workflow_run` generically, in any
workflow. What zizmor (41 audits), poutine (13 rules) and octoscan do not do
is attribute a trigger and a human approval gate to a *resolved npm publish
path*, through composite actions and reusable workflows, with a
registry-precedent fix ladder. That attribution is this release.

## hooks: what runs when the folder is *opened*?

npm-script-lens covers three moments where code runs without you asking:
install time (`audit`/`allow`), resolution time (`sources`), publish time
(`publish`). The 2026-08-04 keyv/ChainDrop worm used a fourth: **open
time**. [Wiz's teardown](https://www.wiz.io/blog/keyv-and-cacheable-npm-supply-chain-attack)
says it plainly: *"Persistence is attempted via Claude Code hooks and VS Code
`tasks.json`"*, two separately-hashed `setup.mjs` payloads, one under
`.claude`, one under `.vscode`. And the tarball half predates the worm:
[hijacked npm packages](https://thehackernews.com/2026/06/hijacked-npm-and-go-packages-use-vs.html)
`html-to-gutenberg` and `fetch-page-assets` (2026-05-25) shipped a hidden VS
Code task named `eslint-check` with `"runOn": "folderOpen"`, firing when the
package directory itself is opened as a workspace.

```bash
npx npm-script-lens hooks                  # scan the working tree (monorepo subdirs included)
npx npm-script-lens hooks --check          # CI: exit 1 at or above the --fail-on floor (default high)
npx npm-script-lens hooks --deps           # also scan every locked dependency's tarball
npx npm-script-lens hooks --json           # { findings, partial, caveats, deps }
npx npm-script-lens hooks --sarif hooks.sarif   # rule hook-auto-run, anchored to the real file:line
```

Two surfaces (one table row each in `src/hooks.js`, adding an editor is a
one-file patch):

- **`.vscode/tasks.json`**: any task whose `runOptions.runOn` is
  `"folderOpen"`, with its label, command+args, type, and whether
  `presentation.reveal: "silent"` hides the terminal.
- **`.claude/settings.json`**: a [documented project-level, committable
  hooks location](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks). Auto-firing events
  (`SessionStart`, `Setup`, `InstructionsLoaded`) tier at full strength;
  agent-triggered ones (`PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, …) are collected, tiered
  one level lower and labelled. The four non-command hook types (`http`,
  `mcp_tool`, `prompt`, `agent`, with `command`, the complete documented
  set) are reported, but never as command execution.

Both files permit comments and trailing commas, so the reader is a tolerant
JSONC parser in the same spirit as [the gyp lens](#the-gyp-lens-what-is-actually-inside-bindinggyp):
a file that will not parse is reported `partial` (with a raw-text hint when
`folderOpen` or an auto event name appears in the bytes), never passed
silently, never a crash. Every command string feeds the **same** shell-signal
extraction and `score()` that `audit` applies to a lifecycle script, the
risk ladder is not forked. Real output for a repo carrying both worm
artifacts:

```
.vscode/tasks.json:4  HIGH  folderOpen task "eslint-check" → node .vscode/setup.mjs (silent)
.claude/settings.json:3  HIGH  SessionStart hook → node .claude/setup.mjs
2 open-time execution entries found (2 HIGH).
```

`--deps` additionally downloads every locked dependency's tarball (cached,
like audit results) and scans it for shipped `.vscode`/`.claude` surfaces, a
folderOpen task inside a *package* is a payload, not a team convention, so it
is **HIGH regardless of command**.

The two surfaces gate very differently, and the tool prints each caveat next
to its own surface rather than one softened blend:

> **VS Code:** a `.vscode/tasks.json` finding means *"this runs once you
> trust this folder and allow automatic tasks"*, not *"this has run"*,
> [VS Code 1.117](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/debugtest/tasks)
> defaults `task.allowAutomaticTasks` to `off` with a one-time Allow/Disallow
> prompt, workspace settings can no longer define that key, and automatic
> tasks never run in an untrusted workspace. The residual gap
> ([microsoft/vscode#309406](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/309406))
> is that the prompt does **not** display the command it is about to allow.
>
> **Claude Code:** a `SessionStart` finding means *"this runs on your next
> session in this trusted folder"*, there is **no hook review gate** before
> a project `.claude/settings.json` command hook fires (*"Claude Code doesn't
> use the same hook review gate as Codex"*, Datadog Security Labs, 2026-08).

Interpolations (`${workspaceFolder}`, `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}`) are kept
literal, never resolved. `.claude/settings.local.json` is out of scope, it
is machine-local and gitignored, so it neither ships in a tarball nor arrives
with a clone.

## review: see what you're approving, not just its name

npm v12's own pending list stops at the script *command*:

```
$ npm approve-scripts --allow-scripts-pending
sharp@0.33.5   install: node install/check
```

What's inside `install/check`? npm can't tell you, [the #1 complaint in the v12 migration discussion](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/198547). `review` picks up exactly where npm stops:

```bash
npx npm-script-lens review                        # show every pending approval with evidence
npx npm-script-lens review --output-allowscripts  # …and write the decisions into package.json
```

For each package awaiting an `allowScripts` decision it shows the script command, the **first 40 lines of the actual file the command runs** (from the version-pinned registry tarball, or `node_modules` with `--offline`), the behavioral scan verdict with signals, the OSV malware check, and publisher trust:

```
── sharp@0.33.5  [🔴 HIGH]
   1.9y old · 75M dl/wk · 1 maintainer · no provenance
   OSV: no known malicious advisories
   install: node install/check
     exec: node-gyp rebuild --directory=src
     exec: require('child_process')
   ┌─ install/check.js (first 40 of 42 lines)
   │   1  // Copyright 2013 Lovell Fuller and others.
   │   2  // SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
   …
```

The pending set comes from your own npm when it can answer: with npm ≥ 12, `review` runs `npm install --dry-run --json` and reads its `unreviewedScripts`, so what you review is literally what npm would block, even before a lockfile exists. On npm < 12 (or `--offline`) it computes the same set from the lockfile minus your `allowScripts` entries (bare-name and pinned keys both count, and `false` is a decision too, matching npm v12's semantics exactly).

`--output-allowscripts` merges version-pinned entries for every reviewed package into `package.json`, preserving existing decisions: SAFE/LOW default to `true`, HIGH/MEDIUM and OSV-flagged packages to `false`, so flip after reading the evidence. `--json` emits the whole review (pending, risk, content, suggested block) for scripting. `NPM_SCRIPT_LENS_NPM` overrides which npm the dry-run uses.

## allow: pre-approve the safe packages, hold the risky ones, in any package manager

`allow` runs the scan and splits every package that has install-time scripts into two buckets, the ones behavioral analysis found harmless (SAFE/LOW) go straight into the allowlist; everything that spawns processes, reaches the network, is known-malicious, or couldn't be fetched (MEDIUM/HIGH) is held back in a `_review` list for a human. It emits the block in **your package manager's native format**, auto-detected from the lockfile, on stdout, with a one-line summary on stderr:

```bash
npx npm-script-lens allow                     # scan, print the native allowlist block + _review
npx npm-script-lens allow --write             # …and merge the auto-approved entries into the right file
npx npm-script-lens allow --manager pnpm      # force a manager instead of auto-detecting
npx npm-script-lens allow --input audit.json  # classify a saved `audit --json` result, no rescan
```

Every major package manager adopted the same "scripts are opt-in, keep an allowlist" model. `allow` writes each one's native format: same risk policy, same analysis, different file:

| manager | allowlist | file | `allow --write` target |
|---|---|---|---|
| **npm** 12 | `allowScripts: { "pkg@1.2.3": true }` | package.json | package.json |
| **pnpm** 10.26+/11 | `allowBuilds: { pkg: true }` | pnpm-workspace.yaml | pnpm-workspace.yaml (comment-preserving) |
| **yarn** Berry | `dependenciesMeta.<pkg>.built: true` | package.json | package.json + `enableScripts: false` in .yarnrc.yml |
| **bun** | `trustedDependencies: ["pkg"]` | package.json | package.json |

```jsonc
// npm project → allowScripts (version-pinned)
{ "allowScripts": { "core-js@3.38.1": true }, "_review": ["sharp@0.32.6"] }
// pnpm project → allowBuilds (by name)
{ "allowBuilds": { "core-js": true }, "_review": ["sharp@0.32.6"] }
```

```
1 package auto-approved, 1 need manual review. (pnpm, allowlist in pnpm-workspace.yaml)   ← stderr
```

> **bun caveat** (surfaced automatically): defining `trustedDependencies` *replaces* bun's built-in trusted list, so packages bun trusted by default (esbuild, sharp…) stop running scripts unless listed. **yarn** needs `enableScripts: false` to turn `dependenciesMeta` into an allowlist, and `allow --write` sets it for you.

### CI guard

`allow --ci-check` runs **no scan**, it's a fast gate for CI. It exits `1` when all three are true: a workflow in `.github/workflows/` runs `npm install`/`npm i`/`npm ci`, `package.json` has no `allowScripts` block, and the local npm is v12+ (probed via `npm --version`). That is exactly the combination where npm v12 will silently skip every dependency's install scripts and your build breaks with no obvious cause.

```bash
npx npm-script-lens allow --ci-check
# CI will break on npm v12: run lens allow to generate allowScripts block.  (exit 1)
```

Any one of those conditions being false, npm < 12, an existing `allowScripts` block, or no `npm install` in CI, passes with a one-line reason. To fix a failing check, run `allow --write`: it writes the auto-approved entries and leaves the `_review` packages out (writing them would be deciding for you, so they stay pending until a human looks).

## Governance policy

By default `allow`/`review`/`sync` auto-approve SAFE/LOW behavioral risk. A `script-lens.policy.json` in the project root (or `--policy <file>`) turns that fixed heuristic into a team decision:

```json
{
  "autoApprove": {
    "maxRisk": "LOW",            // approve up to this risk (SAFE|LOW|MEDIUM|HIGH)
    "denyCapabilities": ["net"], // never auto-approve a script that reaches the network…
    "minAgeDays": 30,            // …or a version published < 30 days ago (needs trust data)
    "requireProvenance": false,  // …or one without a provenance attestation
    "expectProvenance": {        // pin the attested build identity per package
      "keyv": "jaredwray/keyv:.github/workflows/release.yml"
    }
  },
  "waivers": {
    "sharp": { "allow": true, "reason": "vetted native build", "expires": "2027-01-01" }
  },
  "runtimeBootstrapPolicy": "fail" // exit audit 1 on a RUNTIME_BOOTSTRAP finding
}
```

Waivers are explicit human decisions that override the heuristic until they expire, an auditable record of *why* a risky package was trusted. With no policy file present, behavior is exactly the built-in default.

`runtimeBootstrapPolicy: "fail"` is the checked-in form of
[`--fail-on-runtime-bootstrap`](#runtime_bootstrap-installing-a-different-runtime-to-step-outside-the-model):
either arms the gate so `audit` exits 1 when a package installs another
JavaScript runtime at install time. It defaults to `"off"`, so no existing CI
changes colour without opting in.

Be clear about what `requireProvenance` buys you: **presence alone is not a
trust signal**. The malicious `keyv@6.0.0` had valid provenance, and requiring
it would have approved that release; [`--cooldown`](#cooldown-dont-be-the-first-to-install-a-version)
is the defence for that event. `expectProvenance` is the stronger form: it
pins the [attested identity](#provenance-an-identity-not-a-checkbox) to
`"owner/repo"` or `"owner/repo:workflow-path"`. A package whose attestation
does not match its pin, or whose identity cannot be resolved, is **never
auto-approved**, with the reason naming both the expected and the actual
identity. Packages without a pin are unaffected.

## Keeping the allowlist alive, in any package manager

Version-pinned npm entries are silently invalidated by every dependency bump; name-keyed managers (pnpm/yarn/bun) drift as packages come and go. `sync` reconciles your manager's native allowlist with the lockfile, auto-detected and written in the right format:

```bash
npx npm-script-lens sync --check     # CI: exit 1 when the allowlist drifted
npx npm-script-lens sync --write     # drop stale entries, add new scripted packages,
                                     # (npm) re-pin upgrades, PRESERVING decisions when
                                     # the new version gained no capabilities
npx npm-script-lens review --output-allowscripts  # review pending WITH script content, then write
npx npm-script-lens approve          # step through risky packages interactively (npm)
```

## One-command adoption

```bash
npx npm-script-lens init             # scaffold script-lens.policy.json + a CI workflow
```

`init` writes a starter policy and a ready-to-commit GitHub Action (audit + `allow --ci-check` gate), skipping anything that already exists (`--force` to overwrite). Add `--auto-fix` for a Renovate/Dependabot bot workflow, or `--hook` to install a git pre-commit hook that runs `sync --check`. Prefer the [pre-commit framework](https://pre-commit.com)? This repo ships a [`.pre-commit-hooks.yaml`](.pre-commit-hooks.yaml).

## npm v12 approve-scripts bug check

npm v12's own tooling has two known bugs that leave teams with a green `approve-scripts` run and a red `npm ci`:

- **Optional dependency gap** ([npm/cli#9562](https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/9562)): `npm approve-scripts --allow-scripts-pending` never lists optional dependencies, but `npm ci --strict-allow-scripts` still rejects any optional dep with install scripts that is missing from `allowScripts`. The classic trap was `fsevents`: it only *installs* on macOS, so on a Linux CI runner nothing surfaced it, and strict mode failed the build anyway. **This one is fixed upstream**, [PR #9597](https://github.com/npm/cli/pull/9597) (merged 2026-06-23) makes the strict check skip **inert** nodes, since reify removes them before install scripts run; it shipped in **npm 11.18.0** and is in **npm 12.0.0**. So the detector is version-gated: on an npm carrying the fix it drops optional deps whose `os`/`cpu` exclude your platform (`!`-negated entries honored) and reports only the ones that really would install here; on an older npm nothing changes. The report tells you which npm it checked and the version the bug was fixed in.
- **EGLOBAL in global installs** ([npm/cli#9463](https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/9463)): when `npm install -g <pkg>` warns about unreviewed install scripts, the suggested `npm approve-scripts` command errors with `EGLOBAL`, and there is no post-install approval path in global contexts. The working form is allowing at install time: `npm install -g --allow-scripts=<pkg> <pkg>`.

```bash
npx npm-script-lens audit --check-v12-gaps            # markdown report
npx npm-script-lens audit --check-v12-gaps --json     # { findings: [...] }
npx npm-script-lens audit --check-v12-gaps --sarif v12.sarif
```

The first check reads `optional` + `hasInstallScript` from your `package-lock.json`, resolves the actual script names from registry metadata, and flags every optional dep with install scripts that your `allowScripts` block doesn't cover (bare-name and version-pinned keys both count as decisions). The second scans `.github/workflows/*.yml` for `npm install -g` / `npm i -g` lines, checks each installed package's registry metadata for install scripts, and flags the ones without an `--allow-scripts` guard, anchored to the exact workflow file and line. Findings are severity `warn` and never fail the run; packages the registry can't confirm are skipped rather than guessed (except when the lockfile itself says `hasInstallScript`, which is trusted even if the registry is unreachable).

In the [GitHub Action](#github-action) this runs as a separate step controlled by `check-v12-gaps` (default `auto`: runs only when the runner's npm is v12+). It writes to the job summary, emits `::warning` annotations, and merges its findings into the SARIF file from the main audit step so code scanning shows them too.

## Committed audit manifest

The strongest review signal is a diff a human already reads: the PR diff itself. `manifest` writes a **stable, minimal receipt of install-time behavior**, sorted `name@version` → capability kinds, that you commit next to your lockfile. When a dependency change alters what install scripts *can do*, the git diff of that file **is** the approval-surface change, reviewable with zero tooling:

```bash
npx npm-script-lens manifest --write     # writes script-lens.json next to the lockfile
npx npm-script-lens manifest --check     # CI: exit 1 if behavior drifted from the committed file
```

```json
{
  "tool": "npm-script-lens",
  "version": "0.4.0",
  "packages": {
    "sharp@0.33.5": { "risk": "HIGH", "capabilities": ["env", "exec", "obf"] }
  }
}
```

It records *behavior only*, no download counts, publish age, or OSV status, so the file changes when a package's capabilities change, not when its popularity does (live malware/trust checks stay in `audit`). A bump in the `version` field means the detector itself changed and results are worth re-reviewing. In the Action, set `manifest-check: 'true'` to fail PRs that leave the manifest stale, with the drift written to the job summary. _(Requested by [@raju_dandigam](https://dev.to/booyaka101/npm-v12-stopped-running-install-scripts-which-ones-do-you-approve-a-real-audit-walkthrough-b1l#comments), thanks!)_

## MCP server (for AI agents)

```bash
npx npm-script-lens mcp
```

Runs an MCP stdio server with three tools: `audit_package` (audit one package, before an agent adds it as a dependency), `audit_lockfile`, and `classify_allowscripts` (audit a lockfile and return the `allow` split (`{allowScripts, _review}`), so an agent can generate the block non-interactively). Claude Code config:

```json
{ "mcpServers": { "npm-script-lens": { "command": "npx", "args": ["npm-script-lens", "mcp"] } } }
```

Real output for a project depending on `sharp`, `prisma`, `core-js`, `chalk` (39 locked packages, ~5s): see [`fixtures/demo-report.md`](fixtures/demo-report.md). Highlights:

## GitHub Action

```yaml

          comment-on-pr: 'true'   # post the report as a PR comment
```

The action writes the report to the job summary, comments on the PR (plain GitHub REST `issues/comments` call using `GITHUB_TOKEN`, the same endpoint octokit uses), and fails the job when `fail-on-high` is true and a HIGH package exists.

Optional inputs: `diff-base` (audit only packages added/upgraded vs a base lockfile, e.g. one extracted from the PR base branch), `check-v12-gaps` (`auto`/`true`/`false`, the [npm v12 approve-scripts bug check](#npm-v12-approve-scripts-bug-check), auto-enabled when the runner's npm is v12+), `ci-check` (`'true'` to enable, the [allow --ci-check](#ci-guard) gate as a fail-fast Action step: fails the job when the runner's npm is v12+, a workflow runs `npm install`, and `package.json` has no `allowScripts` block, before the missing block silently breaks a downstream install), `sources-check` (`'true'` to enable, fails the job when the lockfile contains [git or remote-URL dependencies](#git-and-remote-dependencies-the-other-two-npm-v12-flips) the committed `.npmrc` `allow-git`/`allow-remote` doesn't correctly cover: insufficient, over-permissive, and invalid values all fail, with an `::error` annotation and a job-summary line), `publish-check` (`'true'` to enable, fails the job when a [CI publish path still authenticates with a long-lived npm token](#publish-will-your-release-workflow-survive-january-2027), which loses direct publish around January 2027, or is BROKEN by setup-node < v7 writing a dummy `_authToken` via `registry-url`; `::error` annotation, a job-summary line naming the verdict, and a `publish-token-cliff`/`publish-oidc-broken` result merged into the audit's SARIF file), `hooks-check` (`'true'` to enable, fails the job when the working tree carries a HIGH [open-time execution entry](#hooks-what-runs-when-the-folder-is-opened): a `.vscode/tasks.json` folderOpen task or an auto-firing `.claude/settings.json` command hook, with an `::error` annotation, a job-summary section, and a `hook-auto-run` result merged into the audit's SARIF file), `sync-check` (`'true'`, fails the job when the install-script allowlist has drifted from the lockfile; cross-ecosystem, auto-detects npm/pnpm/yarn/bun), `trust-policy-check` (`'true'` to enable, fails the job when a locked version resolves [below the highest trust tier its package previously reached](#trust-the-downgrade-a-stolen-token-cannot-avoid), npm/cli#9242's downgrade gate; `::error` per finding, a job-summary section, a `trust-downgrade` result merged into the audit's SARIF file, and exclusions read from `trustPolicyExclude` in `script-lens.policy.json`; registry unreachable never fails the job), and `sarif-file` for code scanning alerts:

```

## Run from source

```bash
npm install --ignore-scripts
node src/cli.js audit --path fixtures/demo --fail-on-high
npm test        # analyzer/lockfile/reporter units, offline mock-registry tests,
                # live acceptance against the real registry, and a full action
                # dry-run against a local mock GitHub API
```

Node.js ≥ 18 (uses global `fetch`). No paid APIs: the public npm registry, plus the free OSV.dev and npm downloads APIs for trust enrichment (`--no-trust` or `--offline` to skip).

## Staying current with npm

This tool's value is coupled to npm's own behavior: the `allowScripts` field, the `unreviewedScripts` shape in `npm install --dry-run --json`, the approve-scripts commands. Those will drift across npm releases, so npm-script-lens is built to notice when they do rather than fail silently:

```bash
npx npm-script-lens doctor          # does this build still understand your npm?
npx npm-script-lens doctor --json   # machine-readable, for scripts/CI
```

`doctor` probes your local npm and reports each contract assumption: version, allowScripts enforcement, a parser self-test, a live dry-run shape check, and each npm-bug detector's upstream status, then **exits 1 on genuine drift** (an npm output shape this build no longer recognizes). Under the hood:

- Every npm coupling lives in one file (`src/npm-contract.js`), a future npm change is a one-line patch, not a hunt.
- `review` **warns loudly and falls back** instead of silently trusting an unfamiliar npm answer as "nothing pending".
- A scheduled **npm-compat canary** (`.github/workflows/npm-compat.yml`) drives the *real* npm across `12`/`latest`/`next` on a matrix and goes red on drift, the tripwire the unit tests (which use stub npms) can't be.
- The two npm-v12 approve-scripts bug detectors are **version-aware**: the report says which npm it checked and links each bug's upstream status, so a detector can't quietly outlive the bug it was written for.

## Exit codes

| code | meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | success (or findings that are warn-level only, e.g. `audit --check-v12-gaps`) |
| `1` | an actionable failure: `audit --fail-on-high` found HIGH/malicious · [`trust --fail-on-downgrade`](#trust-the-downgrade-a-stolen-token-cannot-avoid) (or `audit --fail-on-downgrade`) found a version below its package's historical-max trust tier · `sync --check`/`manifest --check` drift · `allow --ci-check` would break on npm v12 · `sources --check` found insufficient/over-permissive/invalid allow-git/allow-remote config · [`publish --check`](#publish-will-your-release-workflow-survive-january-2027) found a TOKEN or BROKEN publish path (UNKNOWN never fails) · [`hooks --check`](#hooks-what-runs-when-the-folder-is-opened) found an open-time execution entry at or above the `--fail-on` floor · `doctor` detected npm drift · `diff` found an added/modified install script or a [changed provenance identity](#provenance-an-identity-not-a-checkbox) |
| `2` | a usage/runtime error (bad ref, missing lockfile, unreadable input) |

## Commands at a glance

| `audit` | scan a lockfile, report install-script risk (Markdown/JSON/SARIF); `--fail-on-high`, `--diff`/`--since`, `--check-v12-gaps` |
| `allow` | split scripted packages into an auto-approved allowlist + `_review`, in your manager's native format; `--write`, `--ci-check`, `--manager`, `--policy` |
| `review` | show pending approvals **with the actual script content** + verdict; `--output-allowscripts` writes decisions |
| `diff` | compare a package's install scripts (+ implicit node-gyp) and [provenance identity](#provenance-an-identity-not-a-checkbox) across two versions; exit 1 on any add/modify or identity change; `--json` |

| [`publish`](#publish-will-your-release-workflow-survive-january-2027) | classify every CI publish path (TRUSTED/STAGED/TOKEN/BROKEN/UNKNOWN) vs npm's January-2027 token cliff and the setup-node < v7 OIDC breakage, with the migration patch + npmjs.com checklist; `--check`, `--json`, `--sarif` |
| [`hooks`](#hooks-what-runs-when-the-folder-is-opened) | the open-time surface: `.vscode/tasks.json` folderOpen tasks + `.claude/settings.json` hooks, same risk ladder as `audit`; `--check`, `--fail-on`, `--deps` (dependency tarballs, where shipped entries are HIGH regardless), `--json`, `--sarif` |
| [`trust`](#trust-the-downgrade-a-stolen-token-cannot-avoid) | flag versions below the highest trust tier their package previously reached (trusted publisher > provenance > none, npm/cli#9242), pnpm 10.21's `trust-policy=no-downgrade` for npm/yarn/bun lockfiles; `--fail-on-downgrade`, `--exclude`, `--ignore-after`, `--json`, `--sarif` |
| `sync` | reconcile the native allowlist with the lockfile (drop stale, add new); `--check` for CI |
| `doctor` | is this build still in sync with your npm? contract probe + drift alarm |
| `init` | scaffold policy + CI workflow (`--auto-fix` bot, `--hook` git pre-commit) |
| `manifest` | committable behavior receipt whose git diff is the approval-surface change |
| `completion` | print a shell completion script (bash / zsh / fish) |
| `mcp` | MCP server for AI agents (`audit_package`, `audit_lockfile`, `classify_allowscripts`) |

## How it compares

The install-script-allowlist space has good tools, but each covers one slice:

| | behavioral risk analysis | npm | pnpm | yarn | bun | writes native allowlist | policy / waivers | CI drift gate | MCP |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **npm-script-lens** | ✅ exec/net/fs/obf + OSV + trust | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `@lavamoat/allow-scripts` | ❌ (allowlist mgmt only) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | partial | ❌ |
| `can-i-ignore-scripts` | ❌ (lists scripts) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| native `npm approve-scripts` / `pnpm approve-builds` / `bun pm trust` | ❌ | one each | | | | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

The combination, **behavioral evidence** for the decision, in **every manager's** native format, with **policy** and **CI enforcement**, is what makes it the one tool to standardize on.

## Honest limitations

- **Static capability detection, not proof of malice.** A HIGH score means "this script *can* spawn processes", exactly the question to answer before approving, but plenty of HIGH packages (native builds) are legitimate. The lens gives evidence; you make the call. Only sandboxed execution could say more, and running untrusted install scripts to observe them is deliberately out of scope.
- Scripts invoking **binaries from other packages** (`husky install`, `patch-package`) are resolved when a lockfile package with the same name owns the bin: that package's actual bin script is fetched, analyzed, and the row is **re-scored on real evidence** (`bin: husky install → husky@9.1.7` + what the script actually does). Bins with no same-name owner in the lockfile stay conservatively HIGH as `exec: … (unresolved binary)`.
- **Helper dependencies**: capability hidden inside helpers is caught via a curated list (`axios`, `got`, `undici`, `@prisma/fetch-engine`, …) plus `--deep`, which follows bare `require()`s from install-script code into the matching lockfile package's entry file (one level). A helper outside the lockfile, or loaded indirectly, can still slip a tier.
- **Obfuscation**: `eval`/`new Function`/`vm` and string-built `require()`s score HIGH, and base64/char-code **literal** payloads are **decoded and re-analyzed**, so the report shows what the hidden code actually does, not just that it hides. Payloads assembled only at runtime (downloaded, decrypted, env-derived) remain opaque: flagged, not decoded. Plain variable indirection (`require(someVar)`) is deliberately not flagged, it's ubiquitous in bundler output.

[**pnpm11-ci-guard**](https://github.com/Booyaka101/pnpm11-ci-guard), the other half of
the build-script story on pnpm v11.

Once this tool writes an `allowBuilds` allowlist into `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, a
`pnpm install` inside Docker will **prompt for approval and hang the build** unless the
image sets `ENV CI=true`. pnpm11-ci-guard catches that, plus the rest of the v10 → v11
migration that lands in Dockerfiles and CI workflows: `npm_config_*` env vars that v11
silently stopped reading, and images that never `COPY pnpm-workspace.yaml`. pnpm's own
codemod covers neither.

Use npm-script-lens to decide *what may build*; use pnpm11-ci-guard to make sure your
image and CI still work once you have decided.
