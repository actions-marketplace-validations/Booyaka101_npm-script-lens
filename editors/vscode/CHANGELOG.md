# Changelog

## 1.16.0

**The cooldown your package manager applies, next to the one your CI enforces.**
CLI 1.16.0 added the `cooldown` command. All four package managers now ship a
minimum-release-age setting, in four different units: npm counts DAYS
(`min-release-age`), pnpm counts MINUTES (`minimumReleaseAge`), yarn takes
minutes or a duration string (`npmMinimalAgeGate`), bun counts SECONDS under
`[install]` in `bunfig.toml`. So `3` is three days, three minutes or three
seconds depending on which file you typed it into, and getting it wrong does
not fail: the install succeeds and the gate is simply not there.

Two palette commands, following the same shape as the other CLI surfaces here:

- **npm-script-lens: Cooldown config (your package manager vs CI)** runs
  `cooldown` and streams the report to the output channel. OK, MISSING,
  UNIT-SUSPECT or DRIFT, per project.
- **npm-script-lens: Cooldown config, write the matching value** runs
  `cooldown --write`, which commits the threshold in the right file, unit and
  notation while preserving every other key, comment and blank line.

Both need CLI >= 1.16.0. An older CLI reports an unknown command in the output
channel, the same way `sources` and `publish` behave on a CLI that predates
them.

No change to the audit, the panel, the hovers or the decision writer.

`test/commands.test.js` is new and is why this release exists in this shape: a
command contributed in `package.json` but never registered shows up in the
palette and then fails with "command not found" when it is picked, and nothing
here checked for that. It now diffs both sides, checks that every menu and
walkthrough link points at a real command, and asserts the version still tracks
the CLI.

## 1.15.0

**A package that installs another JavaScript runtime now says so.** CLI 1.15.0
added the `RUNTIME_BOOTSTRAP` finding for the ChainDrop pattern (2026-08-04,
400+ packages): a lifecycle script that fetches a Bun or Deno release and runs
its real payload under that fresh interpreter, outside everything a Node-based
scanner watches.

The extension shells out to the CLI, so the risk level tracked automatically.
The *explanation* did not: a new signal kind it did not recognise was dropped,
so a bootstrapping package read as plain "runs other programs" and the one
detail that mattered went missing. Runtime bootstrap is now a first-class
capability, and it **leads** the sentence, ahead of the exec such a package
also does, because "installs another JavaScript runtime" says more than "runs
other programs" about a package doing both.

Version numbering now tracks the CLI again (1.10.0 to 1.15.0).

## 1.10.0

**You can now answer the question the extension asks you.** Until this release
a finding was a dead end: it told you `esbuild` was undecided and pointed at a
palette command that decided your entire project by policy. Approving or
blocking the one package you were looking at is now on the hover, on
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>.</kbd>, and on every row of the new panel.

The decision is written into whichever allowlist your package manager actually
reads: npm `allowScripts`, pnpm `allowBuilds`, yarn `dependenciesMeta`, bun
`trustedDependencies`. It goes through the editor's own edit path, so it is
undoable, it shows in the diff, and an unsaved buffer is not clobbered by a
process rewriting the file underneath it. `test/parity.test.js` runs the
extension's writer and the CLI's writer over the same seven file shapes and
asserts the bytes match, because two spellings of the same allowlist would make
`sync --check` fail CI over whitespace.

bun is the exception, and says so: `trustedDependencies` is presence-only, so a
denial can only be an absence, and defining the field at all replaces bun's
built-in trusted list. Both facts arrive as a warning rather than being quietly
absorbed.

pnpm's `pnpm-workspace.yaml` is the one allowlist that may not exist yet, and a
file VS Code creates takes the platform's default line ending. On Windows that
meant the editor wrote CRLF where the CLI writes LF, so the same allowlist got
spelled two ways depending on which end recorded the decision and every
alternating write was a whole-file diff. New files are now pinned to LF.
Editing an existing allowlist keeps that file's own endings, as before.

**The messages are written for the person reading them.** A finding used to be
a dump of analyzer output, `🔴 HIGH esbuild@0.27.3 (via vite): env: process.env
· exec: child_process.execFileSync() · exec: npm install --loglevel=error
--prefer-offline --no-audit ... · +4 more · undecided, run "npm-script-lens:
Generate allowlist"`. Risk is scored from the *kinds* of signal, so the kinds
are also the honest summary:

> esbuild@0.27.3 (pulled in by vite) runs code when you install it: runs other
> programs, uses the network and reads and writes files. You have not approved
> or blocked it yet.

The raw signals are not gone, they moved to the hover, along with three things
the CLI has always returned and the editor used to throw away: which lifecycle
script runs and its command (`postinstall → node install.js`), why that risk
level and not another one, and who published the version you are about to
approve. The hover is deliberately short and puts Approve/Block under its first
sentence: a hover caps its height, and running the extension in a real editor
showed everything past roughly the sixth line clipped, buttons included. A package published two days ago with no provenance attestation is the
exact shape of a hijacked release, and the hover now says so, and says that
waiting costs you nothing.

**New: the Install scripts panel** (activity bar). Squiggles only cover
packages with a line in a file you have open, which is a minority of install-time
risk. The panel lists every scripted dependency in the project, grouped into
needs-a-decision, approved, approved-against-advice and blocked, worst risk
first, with approve and block on each row. Clicking one jumps to the direct
dependency that pulled it in.

Also:

- **Re-audits when the lockfile changes.** `npm install` is when new install
  scripts arrive, and it rewrites `package-lock.json` without saving any
  document of yours. Previously nothing noticed until you next touched
  `package.json`.
- **One audit per project, coalesced.** Rapid saves used to start overlapping
  CLI runs that raced to paint the same file. Requests now debounce and never
  overlap, with a spinner while one is running.
- **A failed audit is visible.** It used to be one line in an output channel
  nobody had open; the status bar now says so and clicking it opens the log.
- **A CodeLens** over the dependency block with the count still outstanding.
- **A dependency's own `package.json` is no longer audited as a project.**
  Every package under `node_modules` ships one, and opening a few of them
  queued a CLI run each, answering a question about code the reader does not
  own.
- **Bulk decisions report once.** bun hands back a caveat for every denial it
  cannot spell, so blocking twenty packages meant twenty identical warnings.
  yarn's `enableScripts: false` reminder is now dropped entirely once
  `.yarnrc.yml` already sets it.
- `npmScriptLens.trust` defaults to **on**. The audit already fetches tarballs
  from the registry, so this was never the difference between offline and
  online, and publisher signals are most of what makes a decision decidable.
  One request per flagged package, cached for 24h. Set it to `false` for
  behavior-only audits.
- `npmScriptLens.auditOnOpen` (default on) for anyone who would rather audit
  only when they ask.

## 1.9.0

**The audit follows the `package.json` you opened, not the workspace root.** In
any repo with more than one project, opening `apps/web/package.json` audited the
lockfile at the workspace root instead, so the diagnostics painted on your file
described a different project's dependencies. It also read the *root's*
`allowScripts` when deciding what was already approved, so decisions recorded in
`apps/web/package.json` were invisible and decisions made at the root silenced
warnings that were never about it.

The cause was one line: the extension resolved a document to
`vscode.workspace.getWorkspaceFolder(...)` and ran the CLI there, never passing
`--path`. It now resolves to the opened file's own directory and pins the audit
to it. Sibling projects are no longer repainted from each other's results, and
after a write command every open project refreshes rather than only the first
one found.

A workspaces member with no lockfile of its own still resolves correctly: the
CLI searches upward from the file's directory and lands on the root that
actually governs it.

The palette commands follow the same rule. *Generate allowlist*, *Sync
allowlist*, *Review*, *Doctor*, *Sources* and *Publish readiness* act on the
project whose `package.json` is in front of you. *Open-time hooks* still scans
the whole workspace, because it walks a tree by design.

Needs CLI 1.13.0 or newer for the upward search. On an older CLI the extension
still pins `--path`, so it audits the right directory or reports plainly that
there is no lockfile there.

## 1.8.2

House style, no behaviour change. Diagnostic messages, the status-bar tooltip
and the listing prose drop their em dashes: a finding now reads
`🔴 HIGH sharp@0.33.5: exec: node-gyp rebuild · undecided, run "npm-script-lens:
Generate allowlist"`. Which packages are flagged, and at what severity, is
untouched.

## 1.8.1

Listing metadata only. No functional change.

The extension shells out to the CLI, so users already had the CLI's provenance
identity work from 1.11.0 without updating anything here. The Marketplace
listing just never said so, and neither the description nor the keywords
mentioned provenance, attestation or approve-scripts, which is how people
search for this.

## 1.8.0

**Diagnostics on the open-time surface.** The 2026-08-04 keyv worm persisted
via exactly two files this editor shows you every day. Wiz: *"Persistence is
attempted via Claude Code hooks and VS Code `tasks.json`"*. The extension now
scans them where you read them:

- **Inline diagnostics on `.vscode/tasks.json` and `.claude/settings.json`.**
  Open or save either file and the CLI's new `hooks` scan (CLI 1.8.0) paints
  each finding on its real line: a `runOn: "folderOpen"` task or an
  auto-firing `SessionStart`/`Setup`/`InstructionsLoaded` command hook at HIGH
  is a **warning**; agent-triggered hooks and non-command hook types
  (http/mcp_tool/prompt/agent) are **information**; a file the tolerant JSONC
  reader could not parse gets one note (a warning when the raw bytes still
  mention `folderOpen` or an auto event, since broken syntax is a place to hide).
- **Two new commands:** *Open-time hooks (folderOpen tasks / Claude Code)*
  runs the workspace scan in the output channel; *Open-time hooks in
  dependency tarballs (--deps)* additionally downloads every locked
  dependency's tarball. A shipped folderOpen task is HIGH regardless of its
  command (the hijacked `html-to-gutenberg`/`fetch-page-assets` releases hid
  one named "eslint-check").
- Activation now also triggers on workspaces carrying `.vscode/tasks.json` or
  `.claude/settings.json`. On a CLI older than 1.8.0 the hooks scan degrades
  to a one-line note in the output channel; nothing else changes.

## 1.7.0

Version jumps 1.4.0 → 1.7.0 to line back up with the CLI it fronts. If you
installed from the Marketplace you were on 1.3.0, so this release also delivers
everything under 1.4.0 below, and the decision-aware diagnostics are the headline.

- **New command: *Publish readiness (npm token cliff)*.** Runs the CLI's
  `publish` command: will this repo's release workflow still publish after
  npm's January-2027 change (bypass-2FA tokens lose direct publish)? Classifies
  every CI publish path as TRUSTED / STAGED / TOKEN / UNKNOWN and prints the
  YAML patch and the npmjs.com trusted-publisher checklist when something needs
  moving.
- Because the extension shells out to `npx npm-script-lens`, CLI gains since
  1.4.0 arrive with no extension change: `publish` now follows local composite
  actions and reusable workflows instead of reporting a false all-clear
  (CLI 1.7.0), and `audit --cooldown` can refuse versions published too
  recently to have been caught (CLI 1.6.0, a CI flag; the editor audit is
  unaffected).

## 1.4.0

**The diagnostic now knows what you already decided.** Through 1.3.0 the
extension graded every scripted dependency on behavioral risk alone and ignored
the allowlist sitting in the same file. So `allow --write`, the action the
warning exists to prompt, did not clear the warning. The squiggle outlived the
decision, forever, and the Problems panel became something to scroll past.

`audit --json` has always returned its `allowScripts` recommendation alongside
the results; the extension parsed it out and threw it away. It is now read, and
crossed with the decision recorded in your package manager's native allowlist:

| your allowlist | analysis | shown as |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *(no entry)* | risky | **warning**, the one actionable state |
| `true` | agrees | nothing |
| `true` | would have held it back | information: *allowed in your allowlist, overriding the recommendation* |
| `false` | anything | nothing, the script never runs |
| anything | known-malicious | **error**, always |

That last row is deliberate: an allowlist entry is older than any advisory
published after it, so a recorded `true` can never silence OSV.

- **All four allowlist formats are read**, matching what the CLI writes:
  npm `allowScripts` (by `pkg@version` or bare name), pnpm `allowBuilds` in
  `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, yarn `dependenciesMeta.<pkg>.built`, bun
  `trustedDependencies`. bun's list is presence-only, with no way to express a
  denial, so an absent name stays *undecided* rather than being read as denied.
- **pnpm-workspace.yaml gets diagnostics of its own.** pnpm is the one manager
  whose decisions live outside `package.json`, so overrides are anchored on their
  `allowBuilds` line.
- **Writing commands refresh the editor.** `allow --write` and `sync --write`
  change the allowlist on disk, where no save event fires, so diagnostics used to
  sit stale until you touched the file. They now re-audit on completion.
- **The status bar leads with what needs a ruling**: `🔴 2 install scripts to
  review`, falling back to `🟢 3 scripted deps, none to review (1 override)`.
- A package.json that does not parse (mid-edit) yields *no* decisions, never
  blanket approval.
- **A denial wins over a trust recorded elsewhere.** A repo that has used more
  than one manager keeps more than one allowlist, and they can disagree. Reading
  them last-writer-wins let a stale bun `trustedDependencies` entry silently
  re-enable a script an npm `allowScripts: false` had blocked; a `false` from any
  file now sticks.

**Transitive risk is no longer invisible.** Most install-time risk is not a line
in your `package.json`. It arrives through a package you never typed. Those
findings were counted in the status bar and then dropped from the editor,
because there was no line to anchor them to: the count said "2 to review" and
only one squiggle existed. They now anchor on the direct dependency that pulled
them in, tagged `(via a → b)`, the line you can actually act on. A package
reachable from nothing in the manifest is still skipped, and there is now a test
asserting the count and the squiggles agree.

Also fixed:

- **An un-analyzable package no longer renders as a `Hint`.** When a tarball
  can't be fetched the CLI reports whatever risk it had, often `SAFE`, and the
  risk table turned "we don't know what this does" into a dotted underline
  nobody reads. It is an open question, so it shows as information.
- **Editing one allowlist file repaints the other.** `package.json` and
  `pnpm-workspace.yaml` are one decision surface: denying a package in the pnpm
  file clears its warning in `package.json`. Refreshing only the saved document
  left the other asserting something no longer true. One audit now repaints
  every open allowlist file in the workspace.

Message rendering, same release:

- **Repeated signals collapse.** gyp emits one signal per action invocation, so
  the same command arrived several times with extra trailing args. On
  `better-sqlite3` that produced a 273-character squiggle whose last two thirds
  were one gyp action printed twice. Identical signals now appear once, and a
  signal that is only a longer spelling of one already shown is dropped.
- **gyp macro syntax is rendered, not dumped.** `<(SHARED_INTERMEDIATE_DIR)`
  reads as `$SHARED_INTERMEDIATE_DIR`; `<!(`, `>!(`, `<@(` likewise.
- **No more `(npm-script-lens)` suffix**: the extension sets
  `diagnostic.source`, which VS Code already renders, so the name appeared twice.
- **A clean install script no longer gets a squiggle.** SAFE results were `Hint`
  diagnostics, drawn as a dotted underline on a dependency with nothing wrong
  with it. They are a status-bar count now.
- Overflow past six signals reads `+3 more` instead of a bare `…`.
- Every message ends in the action it wants: *undecided, run "Generate
  allowlist"*, *allowed in your allowlist…*, *remove it: an allowlist entry
  cannot make this safe*.

## 1.3.0

Version now tracks the CLI it fronts, so `npx npm-script-lens` and the extension
no longer report different numbers.

- **Two new commands**, exposing CLI capabilities the extension had never surfaced:
  - *Sync allowlist with the lockfile*: reconciles your package manager's native
    allowlist and drops stale entries (`sync --write`).
  - *Least-privilege .npmrc sources*: the minimal `allow-git` / `allow-remote`
    your dependency tree actually needs (`sources`).
- **`binding.gyp` findings now appear inline.** The extension is a thin shell over
  the CLI, so the gyp lens added in CLI 1.3.0 (command expansion `<!(`, `>!(`,
  `^!(`, plus `pymod_do_main`, build actions and `make_global_settings` compiler
  hijacks) surfaces on the dependency's line with no extension change. Native packages with
  no install script at all are the case this catches.

## 1.0.0

- Initial release: inline install-script risk diagnostics on `package.json`,
  a workspace status-bar summary, and commands to audit, generate the
  allowlist (`allow --write`), review pending approvals, and run `doctor`.
  Powered by the npm-script-lens CLI (npm / pnpm / yarn / bun).
